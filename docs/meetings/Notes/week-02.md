Individual Knock-Out Elements The course enforces several criteria to protect the active members of a team.
Students not reaching the following criteria will be removed from the course:

If we fail to meet criteria two weeks in a row we will be removed from the project and will fail the course.

If we fail to meet in one week we will get an email as a warning.



Communication:


If something is urgent we will use the WhatsApp group.

For less important things and calls we will use a discord server which will be created by Ianis.

Starting the project and distribution of tasks:



Tasks need to be devided equaly. 



We will use the pictures on the slides to create the front end.
