# Minutes for week 7 meeting

##### TA announcements:
- Technology assignment were uploaded last night.
- Implemented features and usability/accessibility deadlines on 10th January. (No need to do anything, TA will look into our codebase)
- In order to get all 4 points on each feature (instead of 2), we need to make a MEANINGFUL addition.

##### We need to look into:
- The exceptions being thrown.
- Dependency injection set up but not being used. (Although Ori informed TA that he set it up to occur automatically, she is looking into whether this is valid)
- Missing logic in service classes.


##### TA gitlab feedback:
- Issue titles should be more explicit, they are currently too ambiguous.
- We should try and make multiple commits for each merge request, such that parts of a feature are logically seperated.


##### Deadlines:
- Implemented features and usability/accessibility deadlines on 10th January 23:59.

##### Questions for TA and their answers:
- Stefan asked whether self-destructing pop-up should notify user about only client-side changes or server-side changes as well. TA answered only client-side is necessary.
- Tudor Bordea asked if adding 3 icons is enough to fulfil the multimodal criteria. TA answered it would be safe to add more.
- Tudor Butoeru asked about the meaning of business logic and was given a contextual definition.

##### What everyone did/is working on:
- Beau was sick over the break so was unable to make any additions. This week he will work on client-side testing.
- Stefan's page linking/referencing feature has some bugs and isn't optimised, he will be refactoring his code and writing tests for Ori's collections feature this week.
- Ori already finished his collections feature this week. As part of this feature, he let us know that he added node.collection and node.tag to enable accessing these attributes so that writing queries is not necessary. Next week, he will look into and implement synchronization from the server, and undoing changes.
- Ianis is working on the ability to filter notes by tags this week.
- Tudor Butoeru is working on embedding files in notes.
- Tudor Bordea is working on a self-destructing pop-up that notifies the user when client-side changes occur.
