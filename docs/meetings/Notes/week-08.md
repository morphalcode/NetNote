# Minutes for week 8

# Review of last week's work

- Ianis had a few issues implementing tags filtering because of the changes that are taking place in the program currently
- Everyone's tasks from the previous meeting went alright aside from that
- Ori almost completed the requirements for the section 2.6 in the backlog aside from an error with note updating in between servers
- The new color scheme has sufficient contrast
- Note references still require some work

# General Plans for the remainder of this week and the following week

- Finish everything that we started (relating to additional features primarily)
- Everyone should reread all of the requirements for the extra features to ensure that we can get the full points
- Everyone should also think about what meaningful additions to add to the features they implemented
- From next Wednesday onwards only polishing of the app and testing should be done
- All features that we're implementing should be finished by then
- <s>We should ask Sebastian about how to proceed with tags</s> (completed by the time of this edit)
- Sunday a code refactoring will be done. Everyone should merge all of their branches by then and not make any new ones until the code refactoring is finished

# Individual tasks

- Tudor Butoeru will finish embedded files
- Tudor Bordea will split api into service classes. He will also work on checkstyle
- Stefan will do testing (new tests and rewriting broken tests)
- Ori should make an undo for adding a note to a collection. He will also work on spliting business logic from the rest of the code
- Ianis will finish the tag feature

# General observations

- Section 4.5 does not require a meaningful addition if it is polished enough
- The idea of adding a new language as a meaningful addition was suggested
- Sebastian suggested also translating caught exceptions or other issues (From the discussion with Sebastian after the meeting)
- Collection tests are outdated
- CurrentNoteArea tests are also outdated

**Next week we will receive an email about passing/failing the final criteria before Wednesday. We should use the last 3 days to repair the lines of code.**
