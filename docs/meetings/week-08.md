- Talking Points : ( Inform / brainstorm / decision making / discuss )
  - How did last week's tasks go, did everyone manage to finish their tasks?                                3 min
  - Is everyone satisfied with their task for this week?                                                    1 min
  - What progress has everyone done with their task, any issues to be discussed?                            2 min
  - Deadlines approaching: CODE FREEZE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS/ What can we improve? 
    What is there left to do? What should we focus on finishing before the deadline? 8.5+?                  15 min
    - Finish extensions! Which ones are we satisfied with? Which ones should be improved?
      - Re-read requirements
      - What does improving the extensions entail? 
    - TESTING! The tests are outdated and some don't work or have just one test! Can we trust someone to
      learn mockito and just do tests for this week? Both backend and frontend! Insufficient last time!
    - Bugs & error finding and fixing! Final product should not have any unchecked exceptions or any errors
      printed to terminal! We should be able to handle most errors, and if there is a major one, it should 
      notify user through the app itself.
      - How do we check for errors?
    - Split api into Controller and Server instead of combined! (pretty easy)
    - Split business logic. 
    - Merge checkstyle! we got poor for server build because of it last time. 
    - Make the app look visually better.
    - Javadoc + comments (If we have time)
  - Did everyone read the feedback for Usability/ Accessibility & Implemented features? 
    What can we improve?                                                                                    5 min
