# Meeting

Chair: Tudor Butoeru

Minute: Stefan

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda was detailed enough, and it was a lot more extensive, compared to some previous ones, so great job!
- I liked that you added your questions there, so that I were able to prepare better.
- However, talking points 1 and 3 are pretty much the same. Also, although agenda was more detailed than before, in order to achieve excellent, you need to make it even more extensive.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Notes are concrete, without any unnecessary detail. It is good that you've put your task distribution there.
- Some things seem to be missing, but most of the agreements are there. 


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Chair was mostly in the lead of the meeting at the beginning. They were interrupted a few times, but generally, they were in the lead.
- Later on, however, they lost the lead completely, as a bunch of questions was asked at once. The chair should dedicate a specific time for asking questions, as asking it through the whole meeting distracts the others.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Some of you were quiet during the whole meeting. This is really not fine, everyone should be contributing to the discussion.
- Other than that, the others were having pretty productive discussions.
- However, it is not a good idea to code during the meeting - its purpose is to discuss issues, assignments and work distribution with your teammates.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Most of the basic requirements are met, but the application doesn't look really usable. You have a lot of minor bugs that you should focus on fixing. It should be easy to understand how to use your application. I would suggest to fix everything before continuing with adding more extra features.
- As I said in the meeting, check the grading criteria for "Implemented features". You only get the full points for an extra features, if you add a meaningful extension to it.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Some people seems to be doing a lot more than others. This is fine, but make sure that you are happy with the current contribution of everyone, and if issues occur - discuss it. Keep in mind that some assignment rubrics grade you on that.
