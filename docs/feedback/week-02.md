# Meeting

Chair: Tudor Bordea
Minute: Ori

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Generally, you have to follow the agenda template (as you did)
    but if something is not relevant, feel free to omit it.
    For example, things that are 0 min shouldn't be there.
- However, the talking points were clear and extensive,
    which was nice - it was possible to prepare for the meeting
    just by looking through the agenda.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The chair appeared very well-prepared for the meeting, following the agenda and having a clear plan for what the team would discuss. Great job!

- The chair seemed a bit nervous at the beginning, which is completely understandable given that this was your first meeting.

- Another thing to note is that there was quite a bit of time left after
  covering the agenda. For future meetings, it might be helpful to plan the
  timing a bit more realistically to make the most of the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You took ownership of the meeting even though it was your first one,
  which was great to see!
- The communication was also very good, and it showed that you've already
  communicated beforehand. However, at moments, it seamed that only Ori and Tudor Bordea were talking. 
- Tudor Butoeru and Beau, you were a bit quiet during the meeting. Moving forward, try 
to participate more actively to share your ideas and contribute to the discussion.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Some of you have more experience than others, which naturally made you a
  bit more active in the discussion. In the future, it would be great to
  ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute.
