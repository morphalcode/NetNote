# Meeting

Chair: Beau

Minutes: Tudor Bordea

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback:

- Talking points should be in much more detail. For example, "For each team member: Are our assignments clear / and are they achievable ?" - here, I don't know what the current separation of tasks is. "Do we need to modify tasks ?" - which tasks? You could have put these in the agenda - the more detailed it is, the better I (and everyone else) can prepare.
- One idea is to also talk about upcoming deadlines. You have the "Tasks and Planing" one this week. You could have added a point to discuss if you will do something in order to improve your current planning.
- Tip: If you already know what questions do you have, put them under "TA advice / questions for the TA", so I can prepare better.
- If time is left after everyone has been the chair, I will advise you to write one more agenda.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- You don't need to put everything in the notes. The point of the minutes is to remind you of the decisions you made. Things like who will do which task this week are definitely needed. However, you don't have to put "Announcements - No announcements" as you will most probably not need that information in the future. Another approach would be to just put all important things at the end :)
- Also, notes should contain all agreements that you make. For example - who will do what this week / what do you still need to do for the Code of Conduct.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback:

- Ori took the lead. And the chair should be the one leading the meeting.
- Beau, unfortunately, you had almost no input this meeting. You will have to be a chair once more in the future.
- You tried to take the lead back at the end, but this is not sufficient.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Ori, you should start to listen to the chair (and everyone else) as he is the one, who should be leading the meeting. You interrupted Beau a lot.
- Beau, you are still not participating enough in the meetings.
- Overall, you really need to listen to each other more and include EVERYONE in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You had a lot of progress since last week, so good job! Keep this pace.
- Also, make sure to look at all the other assignments and rubrics as the product is not the only thing that will be graded. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Right now, most of the code is committed by Ori. This is a team project, so make sure to contribute roughly the same in the future.  
- Others are doing fine for now. Stefan, make sure to meet the next knockout criteria.
