# Meeting

Chair: Stefan
Minute: Tudor Butoeru

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Overall, the agenda is good and easy to follow. I know what to expect from the meeting by just looking at it.
- Tip - if questions arise before the meeting, you could put them in the agenda or ask them in mattermost. In that way I will have time to think about them and ask the lecturers for clarifications if needed.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Notes were not added in time. Make sure to upload them soon after the meeting so that if someone doesn't remember what you agreed on during the meeting, they can just see from the minutes.
- Notes were clear and without any unnecessary details. All talking points were covered. Good job!
- You should start using bullet points to make it easier to follow when reading.
- See one TIP for the notes at the end.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- It felt like Ori was taking the lead at moments and the chair should be the one leading.
- You should also make sure to include everyone in the discussion. You should ask about others' opinion when you are deciding on certain things. 
- However, the summary at the end was good - it showed that everyone knew what to do next.
- Also, keep more track of time as you finished a bit late.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Insufficient/Sufficient

Feedback:

- Beau and Tudor Butoeru were quite quiet still. Please, make sure to contribute more in the conversation in the future.
- There were too much technical stuff in my opinion. This leads to one-to-one conversations => not everyone is included in the discussion. You should do most of that outside of this meeting.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Sufficient for now - you are on the right track.
- Make sure not to merge code that is still not working, though. Your main should be compiling at all times.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Make sure to help each other, not everyone is that experienced, and it seemed that not everyone understood what the more experienced ones were talking about.
- Some people showed me what they did and some didn't. I was left with the impression that not everyone worked equally. However, I could be wrong.
- Tip: Put what everyone did in the last week in the agenda or in the notes, so I can easily check the work distribution.
- Summary at the end was helpful - I saw that everyone had tasks to do.
- Tip: look at the rubrics! You didn't know about SMART agreements.
