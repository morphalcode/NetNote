# Meeting

Chair: Ianis
Minute: Beau

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Agenda was added on time.
- Agenda is not much filled in. It should be a lot longer with much more detail.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Very nice notes! They contain all of your agreements without any unnecessary details. The summary of the tasks at the end was also really helpful.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Even though the chair was online, they were actively leading the meeting. 
- The agenda was not that detailed, so you discussed a lot of things outside of it. Agenda should be generally followed so that everyone will know what to expect next.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Still, some of you are too quiet and are not actively participating in the discussions.
- However, discussions feel more constructive than before as many people are giving ideas.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You are on the right track. Most of the basic requirements are already implemented. 
- As I've said before, look through all the rubrics - not only the backlog, as "Implemented Features" is only 25% of your grade.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Looking at your lines of code and the division of tasks from the last minutes, it looks that the distribution in the team is becoming more equal, which is great!
- However, it will be good if you said who did what in the beginning of the meeting, so it becomes clear if everyone has met their goals.
