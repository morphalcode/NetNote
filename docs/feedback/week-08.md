# Meeting

Chair: Ori

Minute: Ianis

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Agenda had a lot of detail and was followed by the chair the whole time. Great job here!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- All agreements are there with no unnecessary detail.
- I could also easily see from the notes what everyone was supposed to do through the week.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The chair had a clear plan on how would the meeting be organised. They were in the lead the whole time.
- The chair should have left a bit more room for input from the others though.
- Also, keep a bit more track of the time as you were a bit overtime.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Some of you were too dominant and some of you were too quiet. Everyone should be expressing their opinions.
- However, there were still a lot of productive discussions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- You had a lot of progress since the last time I ran your application. Great job, everyone!
- The most important thing for you is to check at the end if all the basic requirements are still working.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Some of you has a lot more lines of code, compared to the others, which makes me think that the work distribution is not very equal. As you only have about a week left, I would advise everyone to give their best this week.
