Code of conduct



We are aiming to get to a grade of around 9.0.

Once a week we will divide the tasks for the week equally between the members, and the deadline for the tasks is until next week’s meeting.  We will ensure that each member finished their work on time by communicating continually over the week and also by having a regular check of progress on Sunday(might be changed in the future) of every week when we can also examine the division of the tasks in case we believe they weren’t divided properly in the weekly meeting on Wednesday. This will also allow us to divide the tasks better in the next meetings.  Ori will submit.

Every week we have a meeting in person on Wednesday and also on Sunday or Monday.  We will use Discord for the meetings on Sunday, and we will meet in person on Wednesday. We will use WhatsApp for important communication and the discord chat for less important communication.

Outside the two weekly meetings we will use mainly WhatsApp to communicate and coordinate.

They can get help from the WhatsApp group, and during our meeting.

We will use Checkstyle and the pipelines to determine the overall quality at a glance. Furthermore, it will be the responsibility of the submitter to ensure there are no conflicts. After this, we will manually review the code submitted in the MR, and team members will ensure that it is implementing tests for all methods created, has documentation, and that overall, the code seems to be well written. In case it is not, a comment will be added on the MR to fix the problems with it. This will ensure that the code which is approved to merge with main is always of good quality.

We try to make decisions by having everyone agree. We do not believe that forcing the minority to do what the majority wants will help us reach our goals, and we think that doing so will hinder our relationship and make it more difficult to work with each other in the future. Of course, in extreme cases where everyone except for one person agrees on something, we will follow the majority, however this is something we would like to do as a collective decision if possible.

We hope to not reach this situation, however if we do, the team will ask them in the meeting about this and will try to understand whether it was unavoidable. In case it wasn’t, we would ask for advice from the TA and/or the teachers and figure out if there is any way they can make up for that to the team. Either way, we would try to understand how we can prevent that from happening in the future.

We handle disagreements by having each person express their opinions and try to reach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, we will have to resort to a vote. If someone is late, and they haven’t let us know before the meeting, we will give them as a team, and if someone is late consistently, we will turn for the advice of the TA and/or teachers.
